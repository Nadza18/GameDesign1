Setup in Unity
Tag your player object as "Player".
Attach the PlayerCheckpoint script to your player.
Create checkpoint objects in the scene and attach the Checkpoint script to each one.
Add a trigger collider to each checkpoint (set IsTrigger to true).
What happens:
When the player passes through a checkpoint, a message is printed in the console like "Checkpoint passed at position: (x, y, z)".
You can expand the ShowMessage function to display the message visually in the game using Unity's UI system (like using a text field or notification popup).
